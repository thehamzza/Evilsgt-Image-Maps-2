1) generate_islan_rotations.py Takes the IsleOfMan.jpg and generates it 12 rotations
2) island_annotation.py loops over all the rotations and annotates them using snake model, while saving the annotation data in island_annotation.csv. The it generated what an average island annotation would look like and applies it to fn01.jpg
3) vary.py finds the average island annotation and allows rotations on the average annotation
